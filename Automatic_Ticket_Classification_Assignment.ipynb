that the card is used to make purchase again i did not authorize those purchase i wa shocked that my card wa stolen and used by someone how they used the card and the pin i have no idea i complained this to chase bank they told me i will be reimbursed for my loss and they will investigate they opened 3 claim 2 claim were for atm withdrawal the claim number are claim xxxx in the amount xxxx and claim xxxx amount xxxx both of these were atm withdrawal which were made by someone other than me another claim wa for non atm withdrawal which mean the card wa used by someone to make store purchase a chase told me the non atm claim xxxx amount xxxx chase told me they will investigate and refund me the stolen fund after a week i called chase bank phone number xxxx and to my surprise they already closed the claim and denied it i could not believe that being in a foreign country i went through a lot my card wa literally stolen and used by someone other than me they used the card to make withdrawal they used the card to make purchase i have no idea how they got access to my information but i had my pocket wallet and some cash inside along with my chase debit card the card pin wa not written on the card or in my pocket wallet they managed to get my fund and use the card without chase bank blocking it on top of that chase bank told me they can not help when i called back on about xx/xx/xxxx or so i complained that this is injustice they claimed that visa said someone used my card with my pin number i said this is exactly what i told the bank that my physical card wa stolen and being used by a thief that i want my fund back they said the claim will be reopened and they will investigate again i called the chase fraud department on xx/xx/xxxx and to my surprise they did not reopen the claim on top of that they said the claim wa denied because the physical card wa used to withdraw the fund from the atm i can not believe this that a bank can not protect it client that i have stated so many time the fact that my card wa stolen along with my wallet and someone had access to it without my knowledge when i found out the following day that my card wa missing i reported directly to the claim department but they did not do justice or investigate this claim i have not idea what else to do but chase bank did not investigate my fraud my fund were stolen and i have nowhere to go i want to open a consumer complaint to help me with this thank you\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

being used by a thief that i want my fund back they said the claim will be reopened and they will investigate again i called the chase fraud department on xx/xx/xxxx and to my surprise they did not reopen the claim on top of that they said the claim wa denied because the physical card wa used to withdraw the fund from the atm i can not believe this that a bank can not protect it client that i have stated so many time the fact that my card wa stolen along with my wallet and someone had access to it without my knowledge when i found out the following day that my card wa missing i reported

reopen the claim on top of that they said the claim wa denied because the physical card wa used to withdraw the fund from the atm i can not believe this that a bank can not protect it client that i

              "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers  i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app  i have been with chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful  i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication  the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent  in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud  furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate  report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter  there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet  the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such  imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols  chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab      is most certainly not true  this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest  at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him  i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public  i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly  i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed    \n",

              "21   on xxxx xx/xx/2019  i made a   300 00  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website  i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation  product  or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank  \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xx/xx/2019 explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction  or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient     that xxxx  my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed  however  as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email  some require the expertise of another team  in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team     i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department  i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer  i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for  \\n\\ni called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction  i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent  they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase  s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction  she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation  i ended the call and called chase again  \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time  the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information  she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again  i was once again transferred to the claims department  who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for  after i told her that i had already contacted them  she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured  she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system  in both phone calls  they asked if i initiated that transaction  and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter  \\n\\nduring this whole process  it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation  these transactions are advertised as a   fast  safe and easy way to send money     but seem to be a dangerous way to do business  i feel deceived by chase  s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team    \n",

being used by a thief that i want my fund back they said the claim will be reopened and they will investigate again i called the chase fraud department on xx/xx/xxxx and to my surprise they did not reopen the claim on top of that they said the claim wa denied because the physical card wa used to withdraw the fund from the atm i can not believe this that a bank can not protect it client that i have stated so many time the fact that my card wa stolen along with my wallet and someone had access to it without my knowledge when i found out the following day that my card wa missing i reported
